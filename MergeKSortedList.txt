1. use PriorityQueue (Heap) to sort lists of elements
    fast extract min./ max. : O(log n)

2. by default, PriorityQueue uses minHeap. 
    can provide specific comparator if needed


some thoughts about linkedList:
    - use a dummy to flag the header for return;
    - directly use the initial node, instead of creating a new one with same values, can preserve the link-relations!
