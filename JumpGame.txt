DP:
  - subproblem:
      at position k, the max range is 
        either from k go n steps (n<max)
        or max range from previous steps
        
      i.e. rec(k) = max(rec(k-1),k+step(k))
      
      because only needs the max.value record: only need a int to store, instead of array or table for record
